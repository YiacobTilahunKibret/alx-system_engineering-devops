Alea iacta est("The die is cast"):It is a Latin phrase that means "the die has been cast (thrown)".Suetonius credits Julius Caesar as having said it on January 10, 49 B.C when he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step, he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the senate and began his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. The phrase, either in the original Latin or in translation, is used in many languages to indicate that events have passed a point of no return. It is now most commonly cited with the word order changed ("Alea iacta est") rather than in the original phrasing The same event inspired another idiom with the same mening, "crossing the Rubicon". Generally, it mean things have happened that can't be changed back.
